*Abstract*: The purpose of this project was to gain an understanding of Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and Structured Query Language (SQL) by developing a database for a pizza restaurant. The project involved creating tables, populating them with data, and using SQL queries to extract relevant information for analysis.
